# primenumbers
A program that generates "n" prime numbers, starting at, but not including an integer "s" has been written.

The starting number, "s" does not have to be a prime number and is not part of the "n" numbers printed to the console.

Your assignment: 

As the numbers are written to the console, they should also be saved to a file titled "prime.txt".  Each number is to be written to its own line in the file (that is, when displayed, the file contents should be in a vertical column with one prime number per line). When n primes have been found and written to "prime.txt", close the file.

Now, open the file, read the file contents, find the sum of the primes and append that sum to "prime.txt"
